# Pheromones

## Core idea
- Hexbased map
- Each player starts with a home base that spreads that players pheromone
- Special resource pheromone(s) spreads from other sources in the map
- Players can build various structures on the map that interact with pheromone in different ways, eg
  * Collect resource pheromones
  * Block the spread of pheromones (walls)
  * Spread player pheromone further
  * ...
